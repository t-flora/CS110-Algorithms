    "The running time of check_approx_med depends only on the sorting algorithm used inside of it. In our case, we used bubble sort, an arbitrary decision based off previous needs to use some sorting algorithm, which has an expected runtime on the order of $O(n^2)$. All the other operations in the function are comparisons of time $O(1)$. <br>\n",
    "In the case of approx_med_finder, we apply check_approx_med a maximum of $100/\\delta$ times. Thus, we'd expect the running time to be inversely proportional to $\\delta$. However, given that probability of success increases with $\\delta$, exiting the loop, both factors even each other out. Then, approx_med_finder has the form $O(n^2)$."
